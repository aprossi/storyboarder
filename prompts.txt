a lone mansion perched atop a hill, silhouetted against a stormy night sky, gnarled dead trees flanking the path, a single light visible in an upstairs window

a hesitant visitor ascending the crumbling stone steps to the mansion's ornate front door, their lantern casting long shadows, the door slightly ajar

a vast dusty entrance hall with a grand staircase, cobwebs draping from chandelier to banister, with a mysterious figure partially visible in the shadows of an upstairs corridor

the visitor discovering an ancient study filled with strange artifacts, examining a peculiar antique mirror that doesn't show their reflection, instead revealing ghostly faces

the visitor desperately trying to escape through winding corridors as the mansion's structure seems to shift and change, doors appearing and disappearing, pursued by elongated shadows

the visitor trapped in the mansion's cellar surrounded by multiple reflections of themselves in broken mirrors, reaching skeletal hands emerging from the darkness behind them
